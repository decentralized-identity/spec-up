Pages offer an easy way to scaffold entire page layouts using minimal markup.

The page component is designed to power full webpages. It is flexible enough to handle most modern designs and includes a simple mechanism for handling desktop and mobile navigation.

## Layout Anatomy

This image depicts a page's anatomy, including the default positions of each section. The labels represent the [named slots](#slots) you can use to populate them.

Most slots are optional. Slots that have no content will not be shown, allowing you to opt-in to just the sections you actually need.

## Using wa-page

If you're not familiar with how slots work in HTML, you might want to [learn more about slots](https://webawesome.com/docs/usage/#slots) before using this component.

A number of sections are available as part of the page component, most of which are optional. Content is populated by [slotting elements](https://webawesome.com/docs/usage/#slots) into various locations.

This component _does not_ implement any [content sectioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#content_sectioning) or "semantic elements" internally (such as `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, etc.). Instead, we recommend that you slot in content sectioning elements wherever you feel they're appropriate.

When using `<wa-page>`, make sure to zero out all paddings and margins on `<html>` and `<body>`, otherwise you may see unexpected gaps. We highly recommend adding the following styles when using `<wa-page>`:

```css
html,
body {
  min-height: 100%;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
}
```

If you use [native styles](https://webawesome.com/docs/utilities/native/), this is already taken care of.

## Examples

Open demos in a new tab to examine their behavior in different window sizes. The previews below use simulated zooming which, depending on your browser, may not be accurate.

### Documentation

A sample documentation page using [all available slots](#slots). The navigation menu collapses into a drawer at a custom `mobile-breakpoint` of 920px. It can be opened using a button with `[data-toggle-nav]` that appears in the `subheader` slot. The `aside` slot is also hidden below 920px.

### Media

A sample media app page using `header`, `navigation-header`, `main-header`, and `main-footer` along with the default slot. The navigation menu collapses into a drawer at the default `mobile-breakpoint` and can be opened using a button with `[data-toggle-nav]` that appears in the `header` slot.

## Customization

### Sticky Sections

The following sections of a page are "sticky" by default, meaning they remain in position as the user scrolls.

-   `banner`
-   `header`
-   `sub-header`
-   `menu` (`navigation` itself is not sticky, but its parent `menu` is)
-   `aside`

This is often desirable, but you can change this behavior using the `disable-sticky` attribute. Use a space-delimited list of names to tell the page which sections should not be sticky.

```html
<wa-page disable-sticky="header aside"> ... </wa-page>
```

### Skip To Content

The layout provides a "skip to content" link that's visually hidden until the user tabs into it. You don't have to do anything to configure this, unless you want to change the text displayed in the link. In that case, you can slot in your own text using the `skip-to-content` slot.

This example localizes the "skip to content" link for German users.

```html
<wa-page>
  ...
  <span slot="skip-to-content">Zum Inhalt springen</span>
  ...
</wa-page>
```

### Responsiveness

A page isn't very opinionated when it comes to responsive behaviors, but there are tools in place to help make responsiveness easy.

#### Default Slot Styles

Each slot is a [flex container](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flex_Container) and specifies some flex properties so that your content is reasonably responsive by default.

The following slots specify `justify-content: space-between` and `flex-wrap: wrap` to evenly distribute child elements horizontally and allow them to wrap when space is limited.

-   `header`
-   `subheader`
-   `main-header`
-   `main-footer`
-   `footer`

The following slots specify `flex-direction: column` to arrange child elements vertically.

-   `navigation-header`
-   `navigation` (or `menu`)
-   `navigation-footer`
-   `aside`

And the `banner` slot specifies `justify-content: center` to horizontally center its child elements.

You can override the default display and flex properties for each slot with your own CSS.

#### Responsive Navigation

When you use the `navigation` slot, your slotted content automatically collapses into a drawer on smaller screens. The breakpoint at which this occurs is `768px` by default, but you can change it using the `mobile-breakpoint` attribute, which takes either a number or a [CSS length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length).

```html
<wa-page mobile-breakpoint="600"> ... </wa-page>
```

By default, a "hamburger" button appears in the `header` slot to toggle the navigation menu on smaller screens. You can customize what this looks like by slotting your own button in the `toggle-navigation` slot or place the `data-toggle-nav` attribute on any button on your page. This _does not_ have to be a Web Awesome element.

The default button will not be shown when using either of these methods — if you want to use multiple navigation toggles on your page, simply add the `data-toggle-nav` attribute to multiple elements.

```html
<wa-page mobile-breakpoint="600">
  ...
  <wa-button data-toggle-nav>Menu</wa-button>
  ...
</wa-page>
```

Alternatively, you can apply `nav-state="open"` and `nav-state="closed"` to the layout component to show and hide the navigation, respectively.

```html
<wa-page nav-state="open"> ... </wa-page>
```

`<wa-page>` is given the attribute `view="mobile"` or `view="desktop"` when the viewport narrower or wider than the `mobile-breakpoint` value, respectively. You can leverage these attributes to change styles depending on the size of the viewport. This is especially useful to hide your `data-toggle-nav` button when the viewport is wider.

```css
wa-page[view='desktop'] [data-toggle-nav] {
  display: none;
}
```

If you use [native styles](https://webawesome.com/docs/utilities/native/), this is already taken care for you, and the `data-toggle-nav` button is already hidden on wider screens.

#### Custom Widths

You specify widths for some slots on your page with [CSS custom properties](#css-custom-properties) for `--menu-width`, `--main-width`, and `--aside-width`.

If you specify `--menu-width` to apply a specific width to your `navigation` slot, space will still be reserved on the page even below the `mobile-breakpoint`. To collapse this space on smaller screens, add the following code to your styles.

```css
wa-page[view='mobile'] {
  --menu-width: auto;
}
```

You can use a similar approach for `--aside-width` to hide the `aside` slot on smaller screens. Be sure to also specify `display: none` for the slot:

```css
wa-page[view='mobile'] {
  --aside-width: auto;

  [slot='aside'] {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

### Spacing

A page specifies default `padding` within each slot and a `gap` between the slot's direct children. You can drop elements into any slot, and reasonable spacing is already applied for you.

You can override the default spacing for each slot with your own CSS. In this example, we're setting custom `gap` and `padding` for the `footer` slot.

```css
[slot='footer'] {
  gap: var(--wa-space-xl);
  padding: var(--wa-space-xl);
}
```

## Utility classes

[Native styles](https://webawesome.com/docs/utilities/native/) define a few useful defaults for `<wa-page>`, as well as two utility classes you can use for common responsive design tasks:

-   `.wa-mobile-only` hides an element on the desktop view
-   `.wa-desktop-only` hides an element on the mobile view

## Importing

| \`disableNavigationToggle\` disable-navigation-toggle | \`data-toggle-nav\` Determines whether or not to hide the default hamburger button. This will automatically flip to "true" if you add an element with anywhere in the element light DOM. Generally this will be set for you and you don't need to do anything, unless you're using SSR, in which case you should set this manually for initial page loads. Type boolean Default false | | |
| \`mobileBreakpoint\` mobile-breakpoint | \`50em\` At what page width to hide the "navigation" slot and collapse into a hamburger button. Accepts both numbers (interpreted as px) and CSS lengths (e.g. ), which are resolved based on the root element. Type string Default '768px' | | |

| \`view\` view | \`mobile-breakpoint\` The view is a reflection of the "mobileBreakpoint", when the page is larger than the (768px by default), it is considered to be a "desktop" view. The view is merely a way to distinguish when to show/hide the navigation. You can use additional media queries to make other adjustments to content as necessary. The default is "desktop" because the "mobile navigation drawer" isn't accessible via SSR due to drawer requiring JS. Type 'mobile' \\| 'desktop' Default 'desktop' | | |
