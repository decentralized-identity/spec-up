# Web Awesome

Web Awesome is an open source UI component library with a Pro offering that helps sustain the project. It provides 50+ accessible, customizable web components that work with any framework.

**Pro components and features are available to paid users.** [Purchase Pro](https://webawesome.com/purchase)

## Quick Start

### npm Installation

```bash
npm install @awesome.me/webawesome
```

Import styles and components:

```js
import '@awesome.me/webawesome/dist/styles/webawesome.css';
import '@awesome.me/webawesome/dist/components/button/button.js';
```

### CDN / Project Setup

The easiest way to use Web Awesome is with a hosted project. [Create a project](https://webawesome.com) to get a single line of code that loads everything automatically.

For detailed installation options, see [Installation Guide](references/installation.md).

## Core Concepts

Web Awesome components are custom HTML elements. They work like native elements but with enhanced functionality.

- **Attributes & Properties**: Configure components via HTML attributes or JavaScript properties
- **Events**: Listen to custom events prefixed with `wa-` (e.g., `wa-change`, `wa-input`)
- **Methods**: Call methods programmatically (e.g., `element.focus()`)
- **Slots**: Insert content into named slots (e.g., `<wa-icon slot="start">`)
- **CSS Parts**: Style internal elements using `::part()` selectors
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Customize appearance with CSS variables

**Important**: Always use closing tags. Custom elements cannot self-close.

```html
<!-- Correct -->
<wa-input></wa-input>

<!-- Incorrect - will not work -->
<wa-input />
```

For complete usage details, see [Usage Guide](references/usage.md).
