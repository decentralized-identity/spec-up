## 🚀 Using a Project

A project gives you your own, personal CDN to use Web Awesome on your site. Each project uses a single line of code to install your preferred version, theme, Font Awesome kit...the works! And, when you update your project's settings, your project code pulls in all of the right stuff automatically — no need to update your own code or redeploy your site.

One line of code from us. The entire Web Awesome library for you.

To use a project:

1.  [Sign up](https://webawesome.com/signup) or [log in](https://webawesome.com/login) to create a project.
2.  Copy and paste your unique project code into the `<head>` of each page on your site.
3.  [Start using Web Awesome!](https://webawesome.com/docs/usage)

## 🛠️ Advanced Setup

Projects are our favorite way to use Web Awesome, but different environments (or your own preferences!) may require different installation methods. If you're self-hosting Web Awesome or using npm, refer to the instructions in this section.

### Installing via npm

```bash
npm install @awesome.me/webawesome
```

And then in your JavaScript files, import the components you need.

Web Awesome does not a provide a single import with all Web Awesome components. Instead, you must "cherry pick" the components you want to use.

```js
// Option 1: import all Web Awesome styles
import '@awesome.me/webawesome/dist/styles/webawesome.css';

// Option 2: import only the default theme
import '@awesome.me/webawesome/dist/styles/themes/default.css';

// <wa-button>
import '@awesome.me/webawesome/dist/components/button/button.js';
// <wa-input>
import '@awesome.me/webawesome/dist/components/input/input.js';
```

Once they've been imported, you can use them in your HTML normally. Component imports are located in the "Importing" section of each component's documentation.

### The Difference Between /dist & /dist-cdn

If you have Web Awesome installed locally via npm, you'll notice the following directories in the project's root:

```
dist/
dist-cdn/
```

The `dist-cdn` files come with everything bundled together, so you can use them directly without a build tool. The dist files keep dependencies separate, which lets your bundler optimize and share code more efficiently.

Use `dist-cdn` if you're loading directly in the browser or from a CDN. Use `dist` if you're using a bundler like Webpack or Vite.

### Referencing Necessary Styles

If you're self-hosting Web Awesome, you'll need to set up your pages to reference any necessary styles. You can do so by referencing `webawesome.css`, or you can pick and choose specific stylesheets you'd like to use.

```html
<!-- Option 1: use all Web Awesome styles -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/dist/styles/webawesome.css" />

<!-- Option 2: pick and choose styles -->

<!-- theme (required) -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/dist/styles/themes/default.css" />

<!-- native styles (optional) -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/dist/styles/native.css" />

<!-- CSS utilities (optional) -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/dist/styles/utilities.css" />
```

If you choose to use a theme other than the default theme, be sure to add the corresponding class (e.g. `.wa-theme-awesome`) to your `<html>` element so that the class is applied.

### Setting the Base Path

Some components rely on assets (icons, images, etc.) and Web Awesome needs to know where they're located. For convenience, Web Awesome will try to auto-detect the correct location based on the script you've loaded it from. This assumes assets are colocated with `webawesome.loader.js` and will "just work" for most users.

If you're using a Web Awesome project, you can skip this section. However, if you're [cherry picking](#cherry-picking-from-cdn) or bundling Web Awesome, you'll need to set the base path. You can do this one of two ways.

```html
<!-- Option 1: the data-webawesome attribute -->
<script src="bundle.js" data-webawesome="/path/to/webawesome/dist"></script>

<!-- Option 2: the setBasePath() method -->
<script type="module">
  import { setBasePath } from '/path/to/webawesome/dist/webawesome.js';
  setBasePath('/path/to/webawesome/dist');
</script>
```

### Referencing Assets

Most of the magic behind assets is handled internally by Web Awesome, but if you need to reference the base path for any reason, the same module exports a function called `getBasePath()`. An optional string argument can be passed, allowing you to get the full path to any asset.

```html
<script type="module">
  import { getBasePath, setBasePath } from '/path/to/webawesome/dist/webawesome.js';

  setBasePath('/path/to/assets');

  // ...

  // Get the base path, e.g. /path/to/assets
  const basePath = getBasePath();

  // Get the path to an asset, e.g. /path/to/assets/file.ext
  const assetPath = getBasePath('file.ext');
</script>
```

### Using Font Awesome Pro and Pro+

Font Awesome users can provide their kit code to unlock Pro and Pro+ icon packs. If you're using a project, simply add your Font Awesome Kit Code in your project's settings, and boom! Done.

If you're using Web Awesome through other methods like npm, you can provide yours by adding the `data-fa-kit-code` attribute to any element on the page, or by calling the `setKitCode()` method.

```html
<!-- Option 1: the data-fa-kit-code attribute -->
<script src="bundle.js" data-fa-kit-code="abc123"></script>

<!-- Option 2: the setKitCode() method -->
<script type="module">
  import { setKitCode } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@awesome.me/webawesome@3.4.0/dist-cdn/webawesome.loader.js';
  setKitCode('YOUR_KIT_CODE_HERE');
</script>
```

## React Users

React 19+ [supports custom elements](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19#support-for-custom-elements), so you can import them and use them as you'd expect. Just make sure you've included your Web Awesome theme into your app first.

```jsx
import '@awesome.me/webawesome/dist/components/button/button.js';

function App() {
  return <wa-button variant="brand">Button</wa-button>;
}

export default App;
```

If you're using TypeScript, you can add type safety using the types file located at:

```
node_modules/@awesome.me/webawesome/dist/custom-elements-jsx.d.ts
```

This gives you inline documentation, autocomplete, and type-safe validation for every component. You can add the types to your project by updating your `tsconfig.json` file as shown below.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["node_modules/@awesome.me/webawesome/dist/custom-elements-jsx.d.ts"]
  }
}
```

Another way is to create a declaration file and extend JSX's `IntrinsicElements`:

```ts
import type { CustomElements, CustomCssProperties } from '@awesome.me/webawesome/dist/custom-elements-jsx.d.ts';

declare module 'react' {
  namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements extends CustomElements {}
  }
  interface CSSProperties extends CustomCssProperties {}
}
```

React 18 and below

React 18 and below have [poor support](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/#react) for custom elements. For legacy versions of React, we provide React wrappers for every component. You can find the import instructions by selecting the _React_ tab from the _Importing_ section of each component's documentation.
