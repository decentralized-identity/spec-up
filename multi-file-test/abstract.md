## Abstract

Let's face it, other tools and generators for writing technical specifications aimed at standards bodies or industry groups are cumbersome, underwhelming, and lack the features you might want in a technical specification document. Spec-Up's goal is to deliver you a better spec-writing experience with far less effort and tedium than other tools in the ecosystem. Spec-Up is a dead simple tool that auto-generates great specs from markdown. The version of markdown Spec-up uses contains all the same features you might expect from common implementations, like GitHub, but adds much more, including notice blocks, complex tables, charts, advanced syntax highlighting, UML diagrams, etc.
